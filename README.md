# GITHUB BLOG - CHALLENGE

This challenge aims to develop a blog application using React, integrating with the GitHub API to manage and display issues as blog posts. The project involves creating an interface that allows users to list and filter issues from a GitHub repository, display detailed views of each issue, and show information about the GitHub profile of the user.

The application should provide a smooth browsing experience, presenting issue content in an attractive and functional manner. Additionally, the challenge includes implementing features to search and filter posts, as well as formatting the Markdown content of issues into HTML to ensure proper presentation of the blog posts.
